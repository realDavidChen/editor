保存文件同时格式化相关的设定及出错解决办法.md



Basically, your formatOnSave is on for go which is causing this problem.

To disable it, go to your Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P), type in "configure language specific settings", and look for Go.

You should now see a json file where you can add the following setting to it:

```
"editor.formatOnSave": false.

```
This is how the json file looks like if you just have on setting modified for go:

```

{
    "window.zoomLevel": 1,
    "[go]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": false,
    }
}

```
